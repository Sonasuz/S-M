### Project Description
LUMITUNE: LumiTune is an innovative and interactive piano project that integrates music and visual art through LED lighting. As each key is played, corresponding LEDs light up in response to the notes, creating a captivating audio and visual display that enhances the musical experience. The project utilizes a microcontroller to detect key presses and control the LED lights, ensuring that the visual effect is perfectly synchronized with the melody.  

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Problem1:Percussion concerts(individual piano,guitar,organ concerts) will get bored for the audience when compared to DJ. DJ has light effect to entertain the audience.So as a result people prefer going for DJs than attending percussion concerts and as a result trend of individual percussion concerts decreses in the market .
Problem 2:Now a days children gets easily distracted by social media .So we have to distract them from social media and help them learn any art form with interest without boredom .


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Inorder to help percussionists,we will be providing light effects according to the beats of the music by using a piano.


We can provide kids  small piano with light effect .Normal toy pianos without  light will only hold their attention for some time. Were as pianos which has light effect help them get more involved into playing them.Along with that the sales increases when normal piano is replaced with lumi pianos as small kids gets more attracted to visual effects. 

Both of these problems can be implemented by using two different circuits 
First circuit will be of normal piano were pressing different switches gives different sound. This circuit has of a 7 push button switches (similar keys in a piano) which, when pressed, produce sounds with different tones like in a piano via a speaker.. 

 Second circuit detects this sounds from speaker of first circuit using an inbuilt mic and light effect will be provided according to the incoming beats
